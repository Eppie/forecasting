# Forecasting System

This project offers a command line interface for asking forecasting questions.

## Usage

Install the project dependencies and then run:

```bash
forecasting forecast "Will AGI arrive by 2030?"
```

Add `--verbose` or `-v` to get extra output:

```bash
forecasting forecast "Will we colonize Mars soon?" --verbose
```

The underlying forecasting implementation is still a stub.
